
Hi, Bored and Broke team ----

Very nice work on this Preliminary SDD!

Just a couple of things to address:

1) the use case diagram [at least the one I see] only shows the user as an
   actor.  Where's the other parts of the system that you list, the front
   end, AWS, etc?
2) the state diagram looks good; for the detailed version, make sure there
   are labels on the lines for the actions that move the system from state
   to state, and that the boxes are named with noun states not verbs.
   [Also, the boxes are technically supposed to have rounded corners...
   .....'s all I'm sayin' ]
3) Double-check your grammar; there are some "funny things" like repeated
   articles ["the the database"] and tenses that don't match.

Great job overall.

Fix these items in the next release for full credit on the document.

You have 10% out of 10% which is an A-plus.

Regards,
Prof. Johnson
